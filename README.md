The purpose of NETN-MRM is to support federations where models are represented at multiple levels of resolution and where the level of resolution can change dynamically during a simulation. 

The MRM FOM module specifies interaction classes necessary to enable federation multi-resolution modeling.

NETN-MRM covers the following cases:  
* Aggregation of entities representing subunits and/or physical entities 
* Disaggregation of entities representing a unit into entities representing subunits and/or physical entities 
* Division of simulated entities into parts - resources divided and all entities simulated 
* Merge of previously divided entities.

## Versions, updates and extensions

All updates and versioning of this work are coordinated by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Coordination Office (MSCO), managed by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) and performed as NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) technical activities in support of the NMSG Modelling and Simulation Standards Subgroup (MS3).

Feedback on the use of this work, suggestions for improvements and identified issues are welcome and can be provided using GitHub issue tracking. To engage in the development and update of this FOM Module please contact your national NMSG representative.

Version numbering of this FOM Module and associated documentation is based on the following principles:

* A new official version number is in effect only when a new release is made in the Master branch.
* An update of the major version number is made if the change constitutes a major restructuring, merging, addition or redefinition of semantics that breaks backward compatibility or covers entirely new concepts.
* An update of the minor version number is made if the change constitutes minor additions to existing concepts and editorial changes that do not break backward compatibility but may require updates of software to use new concepts.
* Patches are released to fix minor issues that do not break backward compatibility.
